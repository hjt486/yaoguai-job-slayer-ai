Let's get to profiles/Profiles.jsx

Implement Load button to load a resume, which has to be in these format:

1. PDF, DOC, DOCX, TEX, TXT

2. Once it's loaded, show file name in `resume_name` textbox, this should b read-only

3. Implement Parse button that:

3.1 send resume file to API, with prompt telling API to parse it.

3.2 As for the return format, it should be something strictly defined in DEFAULT_PROFILE_STRUCTURE in Constants.js.

3.3 Once we received the data from API fill it in the local storage as profile, each user can have multiple profiles, and this profile should go to Default Profile with ID =1, this should not be deleted
